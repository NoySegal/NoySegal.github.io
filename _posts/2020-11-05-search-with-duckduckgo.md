A simple [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-with-duckduckgo/amkahembcklobdkoaaepgfpmdnobmdkh) that saves you time when you want to search privately.

It's no secret that some search engines don't respect your privacy or mess with your search results. So from time to time, I like to search in multiple search engines, and especially in DuckDuckGo which is privacy respecting and doesn't manipulate users' search results.

But it takes some time to open a new tab and then type or paste what I'm looking for. So I built this chrome extension to save some time.

How-to-use: You just mark the text you're interested in searching for. Right-click on it, then click "Search DuckDuckGo for...", which then will open DuckDuckGo search results in a new tab.

The project is fully open source on Github: [Search with DuckDuckGo repository](https://github.com/NoySegal/Search-With-DuckDuckGo).
