Project based learning that covers all the cool stuff in C++

For a long time I wanted to learn C++. It's always intriguing learning a new language and it's unique concepts.  
I finally did it during a Technion course I attended - "Introduction to System Programming" (also known as "Matam").

Some of the topics it covered in the C++ part:

* Overloading operators.
* Constructors, destructors and operator=(..).
* The big 3 (copy constructor, destructor, and operator=).
* RAII.
* Static and dynamic casting.
* Friend methods and friend classes.
* Exceptions.
* Template classes and functions
* Inheritenceand, ploymorphism and abstract classes.
* Function objects, iterators, containers.
* STL (vector, smart pointers and more).

The project was a 3-part project which consisted of:

1. A C++ wrapper class to wrap date.c / date.h from the 1st project in C.
2. Events and events containers implementation (variations of abstract / polymophic and inheritence classes / containers / templates / memory management / iterators).
3. A scheduler that connects all previous parts into one major system using STL like \<vector\> and \<algorithm\>

This course taught me a lot.

The project is available on [Github](https://github.com/NoySegal/EventScheduler).
