A simplified AutoCAD application. I made this program to learn more about OOP concepts. There is also the fun aspect of visualising the shapes in a 2D space.

It's a more advanced project with Java and OOP, for learning purposes.

```java
Shape foo = new Circle(...)
```

Currently this program supports only 6 shapes and 4 colors:
* Ellipse, Circle, Parallelogram, Square, Rectangle, Triangle.
* Red, Green, Blue, Yellow.
* No support for overlapping shapes.
* Support for one project per program.

The code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/NoySegal/ToyCAD).
