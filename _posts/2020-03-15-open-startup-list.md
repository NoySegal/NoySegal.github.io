A [list of open startups](https://openstartuplist.com/) and founders [interviews](https://www.blog.openstartuplist.com/).

The website lists all startups and companies that share their metrics publicly, like visitor analytics, marketing experiments and even revenue.

It got a lot of attention and was even featured in an international tech magazine [article](https://t3n.de/news/entwickler-laesst-dich-startups-1265810/).

After 3 months of working on this project, it got acquired.

It's been incredible to grow to over 470+ newsletter subscribers, interview startup founders, get featured on "\open" pages and in blog posts.

I'm currently writing an [ebook about my side-project journey](https://gum.co/side-project).
