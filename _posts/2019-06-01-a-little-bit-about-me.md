I have a strong interest in languages, cultures, technologies, entrepreneurship, and education.

I love doing sport such as swimming and karate.

After I learned how to (properly) code in 2019, I started to build stuff on the web.

I taught myself Object-Oriented-Programming by learning the Java programming language and have taken since then computer science courses at the Open University of Israel, while working as a software engineer and broadening my skillest.

Thanks for dropping by my page.
