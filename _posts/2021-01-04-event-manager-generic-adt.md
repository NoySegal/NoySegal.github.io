title: Practicing Generic ADTs in C

An Event Manager System that relies on a Generic ADT Priority Queue

I learned new concepts by attending a Technion course "Introduction to System Programming" (also known as "Matam").

Some of the topics it covered:

* Function pointers.
* Abstract data types.
* Hide implementation details from naive user.
* Generic ADTs.
* Python (SWIG) to generate a library from C code and use in Python.
* Architect project into small digestable components (Learned it the hard way).

The first homework was a 3-part project which consisted of:

1. A priority queue as a Generic Abstract Data Type (which I implemented using a double linked list).
2. A Date ADT.
3. An Event Manager system that relies on the above data structures functionalities to manage events and members.

The project is available on [Github](https://github.com/NoySegal/EventManager).
