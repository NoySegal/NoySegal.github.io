Custom implementation for the famous Unix grep command.

I developed this program in the Linux environment. I compiled it using the gcc compiler.
To debug it I used gdb. For memory leaks prevention and detection I used Valgrind.

The code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/NoySegal/My-grep).
