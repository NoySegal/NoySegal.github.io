A console-based Python chat application.

For the server I used the Sockets API, using multi-threading it can handle multiple users simultaneously.
I tried to follow PEP-8 writing protocols.

The stream data format:

User Header | User Data | Message Header | Message Data

The approach (also used in HTTP protocol) involves prefixing messages with an header that includes the content length as well as other fields.

The code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/NoySegal/PyChat).
